# load_all(pkg = "echidnaR/")

```

`echidnaR` is an R package that makes it easy to look at the data from the 2011 Australian Census.

This vignette (so far) documents how to access the data, and what it is.

The data is loaded as `abs2011`. Let's look take a brief glimpse of the data.

```{r}
library(echidnaR)
library(dplyr)

glimpse(abs2011)

```

Here we see that we have 150 observations and 28 variables.

Each observation is data pertaining to a particular federal electorate as described by <url to the gov website of electorates>.

Each column is now described here:

```{r create-data-dictionary, include = FALSE}

data_dictionary <- data_frame(
  Variable = c(
    "ID",
    "Name",
    "State",
    "Population",
    "Area",
    "MedianIncome",
    "Unemployed",

    "NoReligion",
    "Age0_4...Age85Plus",
    "BornOverseas",
    "Indigenous",
    "EnglishOnly",
    "OtherLanguageHome",
    "Married",
    "DeFacto",
    "FamilyRatio"
    ), 
  Details = c(
    "ID is the primary key that links this dataset to the other datasets in this R package",
    "Name is the name of the federal electorate",
    "State is the state, these include QLD for Queenland, NSW for New South Wales, Vic for Victoria, NT for Northern Territory, WA for Western Australia, Tas for Tasmania, ACT for Australian Capital Territory, SA for South Australia.",

Some small gripes.

- Variable names: Should they not be capitalised?
- State names: These are capitalised for ACT and NSW, but not for Qld and Vic
